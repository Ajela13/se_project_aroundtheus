**Plan of improving the project**

- Display the cumulative number of likes alongside the like button, updating dynamically as users interact with the post.

-Explore animations that respond to user actions, such as a subtle pulse effect when hovering over the like button or a dynamic burst animation upon clicking.

-Design animations that provide clear and intuitive feedback to users when interacting with the like button.
