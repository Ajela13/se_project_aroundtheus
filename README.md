**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

**Plan of improving the project**

- Display the cumulative number of likes alongside the like button, updating dynamically as users interact with the post.

-Explore animations that respond to user actions, such as a subtle pulse effect when hovering over the like button or a dynamic burst animation upon clicking.

-Design animations that provide clear and intuitive feedback to users when interacting with the like button.

.Offer users the flexibility to customize animation preferences for image cards according to their preferences.
